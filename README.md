# LyricSimilarity
Various visualization of song lyric data, mostly PCA and LDA. 

Read my full process and analysis here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vS_TdZS1EC4r1J6VunEHdu2yZbTUmLgAfpIchFljUkDAu4npJrkgVfe2vblsEKA6mp4KOXgjSOi-Wih/pub

RunMe.py contains the entirety of the codebase.
Songs.csv is the dataset used to generate the images in the Visualizations directory.
LDA.csv and RelativeFrequencies.csv are both files written each time the program runs. 
topSongsLyrics1905_2019.csv is the original dataset I attempted to use but proved to have errors.
